    <a href=https://browsergap.xyz/>BrowserGap is a fully isolated cloud browser that runs secure in your regular browser</a>, and provides a fully interactive image of the remote web page, that looks and feels just like browsing on your favorite consumer browser, but without any of the regular risks associated with that. You can easily open new tabs, watch video (at a reduced frame rate), download files and even play audio.
  <p>
    BrowserGap is the simplest and best browser isolation 
    platform. We put the customer first, and provide the 
    most similar experience to browsing on your local machine, without
    the risks. Our fault-tolerant browser-as-a-service infrastructure 
    enables the secure provision of fully managed, 
    fully hosted and fully remote cloud browsers. 
    Our familiar web client looks and feels just like using your popular web browser, 
    and runs in all modern and legacy browsers, even on mobile.
